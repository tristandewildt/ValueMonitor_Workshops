Kara Swisher: Today in the red chair I’m in Los Angeles talking to James Corden, the host of “The Late Late Show” on CBS. Originally a theater and TV actor based in the U.K., since March 2015 he’s become [\u001b[1m\u001b[31msomething\u001b[0m\u001b[0m] of an internet celebrity — I don’t know if he’d call himself that — thanks to “The Late Late Show’s” many viral videos. You’ve probably seen his “Carpool Karaoke” videos in which he drives and sings with celebrities ranging from Adele to Lin-Manuel Miranda to Michelle Obama. James, welcome to\n",
                  "\n",
                  " - and TV shows and things like that. So talk about how you got to “The Late Late Show” and then we’ll talk about sort of the phenomenon you’ve created there. Um, well. I mean, I’m an actor first and foremost and I worked in the U.K. and I’d done a [\u001b[1m\u001b[31mfew\u001b[0m\u001b[0m] plays and a couple of films. I worked with directors like Mike Leigh and Shane Meadows and people like that. And I'd worked at the National Theater and done a play in New York called “The History Boys,” which did very well. And then I wrote a sitcom called “Gavin\n",
                  "\n",
                  " - and said, “How should we get this guy on our network?” And I’d shot a film called “Into the Woods,” and I was writing a new show for HBO. And I was going to go back to New York and do a musical called “A Funny Thing Happened on the [\u001b[1m\u001b[31mWay\u001b[0m\u001b[0m] to the Forum” … Great musical — Zero Mostel was in the original. That’s right. So I was going to play that role on Broadway, which I was of course very much looking forward to, and CBS had asked if I’d write a show for them, and I had said\n",
                  "\n",
                  " - had said no. And I had gone to Les and the then-president, Nina Tassler, to explain why. And we got talking about “Late Night,” and I told them how incredible I thought Stephen Colbert’s appointment was and how swiftly they dealt with it. I thought it was very classy the [\u001b[1m\u001b[31mway\u001b[0m\u001b[0m] they dealt with it. And we started talking about how I felt [about] the show after it — Craig Ferguson had just said he was going to step down. And I said I felt like unless they find a show that will embrace the internet and reach out its arms\n",
                  "\n",
                  " - doing a talk show? Not really. Because you’d done musical theater, movies with music … No, I was very reticent to do it is the truth. I really wasn’t sure if it was the right thing to do. But I came to the conclusion that I’d much rather regret doing [\u001b[1m\u001b[31msomething\u001b[0m\u001b[0m] than not doing something. And as far as being an internet person, I don’t see a huge divide between … Right, as many in Hollywood do. I do see a divide between my phone, my computer screen and my television. Like, at best, at very best, it’s a blurred line,\n",
